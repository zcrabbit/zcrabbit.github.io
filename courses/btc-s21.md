### Description and Objectives
The objective of this course is to explore Bayesian statistical theories and methods, and discuss their application in real life problems. Students would learn how to formulate a scientific question by constructing a Bayesian model, and perform Bayesian statistical inference to answer that question. Throughout this course, students would be exposed to the theory of Bayesian inference. They would also learn several computational techniques, such as importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, variational inference (VI), and use these techniques for Bayesian analysis of real data. Additional topics may vary. Coursework will include computer assignments.

### Prerequisites
Multivariate calculus, linear algebra, graduate level courses in probability and statistics, applied stochastic processes

### Grading
- 4 problem sets (15% each), 60%
- final project (40%): midterm proposal (5%) + oral presentation (10%) + final write-up (25%)

There will be `7` free late days in total, use them in your own ways. Afterwards, late homework will be discounted by 25% for each additional day. Not acceptable after `3` late days per problem set (PS). Late policy `does not apply` to the final project, please submit it on time. Discussing assignments verbally with your classmates is allowed and encouraged. However, you should finish your work independently. Identified cheating incidents will be reported and will result in zero grades.

### Computer and Technical Requirements

We will use python during the course. A good Python tutorial is available at <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>. You may also find another shorter tutorial useful at <http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/>. If you have never used Python before, I recommend using Anaconda Python 3.7 <https://www.continuum.io/>.

<!-- ### Assignments -->


### Final Project
You may structure your project exploration around a general problem type, algorithm, or data set, but should explore around your problem, testing thoroughly or comparing to alternatives. You may work on the project as teams. Each team may have up to `4` people. Please form your team by the end the `4th` week. You should present a project proposal that briefly describe your project concept and goals in one slide at midterm. You should turn in a write-up (< 10 pages) describing your project and its outcomes, similar to a research-level publication. I suggest the latex styles for [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) or [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers). There will be in class project presentation at the end of the term. Not presenting your projects will be taken as voluntarily `giving up` the opportunity for the final write-ups.
